# advent_of_code

This is a collection of my Advent of Code 2022 programs, inputs, and solutions.

I'm mainly posting them here so that I start using GitHub a little more and get a better feel for it.

Maybe one day I'll look back on these programs and reminisce about the time I wrote them and what was going through my head....
